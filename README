This I a preliminary code folder to assist with a research project I am no longer involved in. 

This Repository will contain all of the reliving files to that project. 

This program is meant to be used to test the soil moisture for a prolonged period without exterior input

Below Is a list of the contained files and their uses

SdFat.Zip - The relevant Libraries for the SD Card read.write module
SdFat - Unzipped Libraries for the SD Card reader 
MicroSD ModuleV1.0_Sch.ph - the wiring schematic for the sd module
SparkFun_Soil_Moisture_Sensor.pdf - Wiring schematic for the moisture sensor
SparkFun_Soil_Moisture_Sensor.zip - These file relate to the soil moisture sensor but you probably wont need them
SoilMoistureOnly_Example - this is an Arduino program I found related to the moisture sensor the SDCard is not implemented
